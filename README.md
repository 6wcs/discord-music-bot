# discord-music-bot

Don't forget to replace 'TOKEN' with your actual Discord bot token.

This script provides basic functionality for playing music in a voice channel. Users can use the !join command to make the bot join their current voice channel, the !play command to play music from a provided URL, and the !leave command to make the bot leave the voice channel.

Remember to install the discord.py library using pip install discord.py if you haven't already. Additionally, you'll need to have FFmpeg installed on your system for audio streaming to work properly.
