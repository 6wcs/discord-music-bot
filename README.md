# discord-music-bot

Make sure to replace 'TOKEN' with your actual Discord bot token.

This script provides basic functionality for playing music in a voice channel. Users can use the !join command to make the bot join their current voice channel, the !play command to play music from a given URL, and the !leave command to make the bot leave the voice channel.

Remember, for this script to work, you'll need to install the discord-voice library alongside discord.py using pip install discord.py discord-voice.

Additionally, you'll need the FFmpeg tool installed on your system for audio streaming to work properly. You can download FFmpeg from its official website and ensure it's added to your system's PATH.
